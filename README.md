# Added-Interaction
Farther along Fox Ponson site w added JS elements

Blended elements of my previous website layouts/designs. Iterative of "Personal-Webpage" repository

Combined earlier design examples such as:
3x3 grid box photo collage w css hover
Stacked UL of 3 music tracks, standard audio ui
Familiar background & text color scheme
Grid photos scale on hover
Header nav links
FoxPonson fox favicon

Changes:
Went for a stacked center approach for adaptive ease
Opted for a more spatial floaty look, no opaque background, no solid header & footer
Added Google Font - Cardo Serif, Regular & Bold
Added background starry overlay, in & out animated opacity, JS
Opted for a linear gradient background, gradient shift animated, ease-in-out infinite, CS
Altered background & text color scheme, brighter, familiar
Made header taller
Replaced header text w FoxPonson Established logo, official brand title
New header logo scales w viewport
Added animated fox around star in header, linear infinite, CS
Changed & shortened About Me text, no mention of "UpWords Media", may make a return sometime in the future

Java Features:
Alert, welcoming text, event
Background, starry overlay, animation
